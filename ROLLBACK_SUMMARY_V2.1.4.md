## üéØ **Rollback Plan**

### **Step 1: Restore Stable Service Worker**
```bash
# Restore the simple, working service worker
# Remove the complex CSP-violating service worker
```

### **Step 2: Restore Simple CSP Configuration**
```bash
# Remove the complex CSP configuration
# Use the simple, working CSP from v2.1.2
```

### **Step 3: Restore Simple Server Configuration**
```bash
# Remove the complex Vite checking logic
# Use the simple, working server configuration
```

### **Step 4: Keep Working Changes**
- Keep the enhanced build script
- Keep the improved cache management
- Keep the Vite configuration improvements

## üìã **Files to Rollback**

### **High Priority (Causing Issues):**
1. `frontend/public/sw.js` - Restore to simple version
2. `backend/public/sw.js` - Restore to simple version  
3. `backend/server.js` - Remove complex CSP and Vite checking

### **Medium Priority:**
4. `frontend/index.html` - Remove complex Google Fonts handling

### **Keep (Working):**
5. `scripts/build-production.ps1` - Enhanced build process
6. `frontend/vite.config.js` - Better Vite configuration
7. `clear-cache.html` - Enhanced cache management

## üöÄ **Rollback Execution**

The rollback will:
1. **Remove** the complex service worker that's causing CSP violations
2. **Restore** the simple, working CSP configuration
3. **Simplify** the server configuration
4. **Keep** the working build and cache improvements

This will restore the stable functionality while preserving the working improvements.

## üìä **Expected Result After Rollback**

- ‚úÖ No more CSP violations
- ‚úÖ No more download prompts in Chrome
- ‚úÖ No more 404 errors for static assets
- ‚úÖ Google Fonts loading correctly
- ‚úÖ Service worker working without interference
- ‚úÖ Enhanced build process still working
- ‚úÖ Better cache management still available

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

The issues were caused by:
1. **Over-engineering** the service worker with complex logic
2. **Aggressive CSP configuration** that was too restrictive
3. **Service worker interference** with normal browser requests
4. **Complex external resource filtering** that broke Google Fonts

The stable version (2.1.2) had a simple, working approach that didn't interfere with normal browser functionality.
