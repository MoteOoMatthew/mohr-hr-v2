# CSP and Service Worker Fixes - Version 2.1.4

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues

**Problem**: Google Fonts were being blocked by CSP in production mode, causing font loading failures and CSP violations.

**Root Cause**: 
- CSP configuration was missing proper directives for Google Fonts
- Service worker was trying to intercept Google Fonts requests, causing CSP violations

**Solution**:
- Updated CSP configuration in `backend/server.js` to properly allow Google Fonts
- Added `fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com", "data:"]` directive
- Added `connectSrc` directive to allow font API connections
- Enhanced CSP with additional security directives

### 2. Service Worker Issues

**Problem**: 
- Service worker was causing download prompts in Chrome
- CSP violations when intercepting Google Fonts requests
- 404 errors for static assets due to versioning mismatches

**Root Cause**:
- Service worker was intercepting all requests including Google Fonts
- Asset versioning was inconsistent between builds
- Service worker wasn't properly handling CSP-restricted requests

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote service worker with better CSP compliance
- Added special handling for Google Fonts requests to avoid CSP violations
- Improved asset caching strategy
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Asset Versioning Issues

**Problem**: Browser was requesting assets with different hashes than available, causing 404 errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Vite build configuration wasn't ensuring consistent asset hashing
- Service worker cache wasn't properly invalidated

**Solution**:
- Updated Vite configuration for consistent asset naming
- Enhanced build script to ensure proper asset copying
- Improved service worker cache management

   - Added manifest generation
   - Improved dependency optimization

### Build Script Changes
1. **`scripts/build-production.ps1`**
   - Enhanced build process
   - Better asset copying
   - Verification steps

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Development Mode
```powershell
# Start development environment
.\scripts\start-dev.ps1
```

### 2. Production Mode
```powershell
# Build for production
.\scripts\build-production.ps1

# Start production server
cd backend
npm start
```

### 3. Verification Steps
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Check browser console for CSP violations
3. Verify Google Fonts load properly
4. Test offline functionality
5. Check service worker registration

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ CSP violations in console
- ❌ Google Fonts not loading
- ❌ Download prompts in Chrome
- ❌ 404 errors for assets
- ❌ Service worker errors

### After Fix
- ✅ No CSP violations
- ✅ Google Fonts load properly
- ✅ No download prompts
- ✅ All assets load correctly
- ✅ Service worker works without errors
- ✅ Offline functionality preserved

## Browser Compatibility

## Security Improvements

1. **Enhanced CSP**: More comprehensive security policy
2. **Font Security**: Proper font loading without CSP violations
3. **Service Worker Security**: Better request handling
4. **Asset Security**: Consistent and secure asset delivery

## Performance Improvements

1. **Better Caching**: Enhanced service worker caching strategy
2. **Font Optimization**: Proper Google Fonts loading
3. **Asset Optimization**: Consistent asset hashing and delivery
4. **Build Optimization**: Improved Vite configuration

## Deployment Notes

### Local Development
- Development mode disables CSP for easier debugging
- Vite dev server handles hot reloading
- Service worker is disabled in development

### Production Deployment
- CSP is enabled with proper directives
- Static assets are served from backend
- Service worker provides offline functionality
- All security headers are active

## Troubleshooting

### If CSP Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for specific violations
2. Verify CSP configuration in `backend/server.js`
3. Ensure Google Fonts URLs are properly allowed

### If Service Worker Issues Persist
1. Clear browser cache and service worker
2. Visit `/clear-cache.html` to reset service worker
3. Check service worker registration in browser dev tools

### If Asset Loading Issues Persist
1. Rebuild the application using build script
2. Verify assets are properly copied to `backend/public`
3. Check asset paths in browser network tab

## Future Improvements

1. **IndexedDB Integration**: Implement proper offline data storage
2. **Background Sync**: Enhanced offline request queuing
3. **Push Notifications**: Add notification support
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add service worker performance metrics
