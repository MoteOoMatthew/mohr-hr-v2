## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### **Key Decisions Made**
- **Authentication**: Hybrid approach (email/password + optional Google)
- **Privilege Levels**: 5 levels with expansion capability
- **Google Integration**: Service access only, not primary auth
- **E2EE**: Maintained for critical data, TLS for Google services

### **Technical Decisions**
- **Database**: SQLite with E2EE for sensitive data
- **Frontend**: React with privilege-aware components
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with JWT authentication
- **Google APIs**: Minimal scope, privilege-based access

### **Security Considerations**
- E2EE for critical HR data
- TLS for all external communications
- Privilege-based access control
- Audit logging for all actions
- Secure token management
