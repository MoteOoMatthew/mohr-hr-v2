## üöÄ How to Trigger Emergency Logout

### Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (Recommended)
- **Press**: `Ctrl + Shift + E` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + E` (Mac)
- **Result**: Immediate emergency logout with data purging

### Method 2: Triple-Click App Logo
- **Action**: Triple-click the "MOHR HR" logo in the sidebar
- **Result**: Emergency logout triggered

### Method 3: UI Button

2. **Fresh start**: No cached data or settings remain
3. **New encryption keys**: E2EE keys are regenerated on next login

### Data Restoration
- **Server-side data**: Remains intact and secure
- **User preferences**: Must be reconfigured
- **Offline data**: Must be re-downloaded

## üéì Training Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Memorize keyboard shortcut**: `Ctrl + Shift + E`
2. **Practice in safe environment**: Test the feature
3. **Understand consequences**: Know what data will be lost
4. **Physical safety first**: Always prioritize personal safety

### For Administrators
1. **Document the feature**: Include in security training
2. **Regular testing**: Ensure feature works correctly
3. **User education**: Train staff on when to use it
4. **Incident response**: Have procedures for post-emergency logout

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### When to Use
- **Immediate security threat**: Someone approaching your device
- **Suspicious activity**: Unusual behavior or access attempts
- **Physical danger**: Need to quickly secure data
- **Device compromise**: Suspected malware or unauthorized access

### Limitations
- **Local data only**: Server-side data remains secure
- **Browser dependent**: Only works within the web application
- **No remote wipe**: Cannot purge data from other devices
- **Physical access**: Device must be accessible to user

### Best Practices
1. **Use immediately**: Don't hesitate if security is compromised
2. **Physical safety first**: Ensure personal safety before data security
3. **Report incidents**: Notify administrators after using emergency logout
4. **Change passwords**: Update other account passwords if compromised
5. **Restart device**: For maximum security after emergency logout
